# Meaty Skeleton

This is a minimal operating system built following the tutorial on the [OS Dev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton).

It has been created to learn more about OS development, following on from the [Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) which was completed in the (now archived) repository, [OS-BareBones](https://github.com/moddedTechnic/OS-BareBones). As it is an educational project, [notes](notes.md) have been taken on the process.
